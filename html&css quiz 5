rgba(0,10,20,0)
a alpha has only 0 or 1 as value.



border: 10px red;   -> wrong
border-style has none as default value.
border: 10px solid;   -> works
border: red double;   -> works

border-style should be solid, double, hidden, dotted, dashed, groove, ridge, inset or outset.
if not, it wouldn't work.
